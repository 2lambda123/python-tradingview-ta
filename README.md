# TradingView-TA Has Been Archived
It's been 6 months since the last release of TradingView-TA, and I've made the decision to no longer maintain this repository. 
Managing a somewhat large and complex project like this has been a great learning experience for me.

# Reason for Archiving
Unfortunately, I have lost the motivation to continue maintaining this repository. 
While I originally created it as part of my trading bot, I have since lost interest in trading, cryptocurrency, and the stock market. 
I initially developed TradingView-TA as a hobby project, never expecting it to gain such popularity with hundreds of stars and 200k+ downloads. 
Besides, the code is currently a mess and requires refactor/rewrite, and I lack the time and financial incentives to do so. 
Consequently, there is no sense in maintaining a project that I no longer use.

# What's Next
The code on the `main` branch will remain accessible, and it should work until TradingView introduces any breaking changes. 
If you are interested in maintaining it, feel free to fork the repository and shoot an email to tvta-maintainer [at] brianthe.dev to transfer PyPI/RTD ownership, and I'll link your repo here. 
Both [TVDB](https://tvdb.brianthe.dev/) and [Demo](https://tradingview.brianthe.dev/) will remain accessible for the time being.

Thank you to everyone who has supported TradingView-TA along the way!
